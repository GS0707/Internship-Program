    <h1>Camelids</h1>
    <p>
        The four Llamas and two camels are camelids.
        Camelids tend to be large and are strictly herbivorous.
        Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways.
        They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered
        digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in two with
        each part separately mobile; and an isolated incisor in
        the upper jaw. They have long legs that, because they
        lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,
        look longer still. (from Wikipedia)
